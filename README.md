1.	Choose a target organisation
For my POE I have decided to create a website for my Girlfriends business this is a small business with no current website. This business will be perfect for my POE as it is small and a baking business. This business has been running for approximately 4 years and has been an on and off business until Louisa(business partner and daughter) started doing markets and promoting the business this helped the business to grow and expand and now they need a website to take the next step in their business journey a website will really benefit their business as it will help to bring more traffic and attention to the small baking business it will also allow customers who cant make it to the market order for family functions and formal functions.

 
2.	Research and planning
2.1	Website project proposal
1.	Organisation overview 
•	NAME: The Littlest Homestead 
•	Brief history of the organisation: This is business is run by a mother and daughter duo it started out as a shop called bakeable’s which unfortunately did not work out, so they switched tactics and started doing markets and orders and slowly but surely building a loyal customer basis.
•	Mission And Vision Statements: We aim to produce top quality homemade products using locally source ingredients.
•	Target Audience: People who enjoy local markets as well as event planners

2.	Define specific goals for the website
•	For this website the business owners are looking to increase website traffic as well as to sell goods the goods that they sell are baked goods that can be ordered from the website they are looking to also be informative of markets that they will be attending.
•	As for KPI’s this business is small and does not have any KPI’s in the form of tables and graphs however they do have quality control which normally starts with making the dough and leaving it to proof over 24 Hours and baking the goods in the morning to allow for the goods to be as fresh as possible on a market day they have also gone through many products to test and see which products sell the best and are always trying new recipes and improving their current recipes as well as updating their equipment to allow for easier baking and transportation of the products.

3.	Current website analysis 
•	Unfortunately, there is no current website for the business, so this section is not applicable. 

4.	Proposed website features and functionality
•	The proposed website features would be to have a home page with information about the business as well as a brief history of the business. There must also be an events page this page will serve as a reminder page of when and where the markets that the business will be attending. The next page will be an enquiries page this will be for people who are looking to do a large custom order of products and for unique questions that can’t be answered by the FAQ’s page. The next page that will be added will be a FAQ’s page this page will be for general question answering. The next page to be added to the website will be a store page where people can do an order with a minimum and maximum amount that you can order this will be linked to a checkout page where the order will be sent to the business owners where the customer will have to provide proof of payment and the order will have to accepted by the business owner there will also be updates of the order as the order is being made.

5.	Design And User Experience
•	The design of the website has not yet been fully fleshed out by the owners however they would like the website to have a mute earthy feel to it almost like a homestead a warm feeling website with browns and greens with a bit of yellow and small amounts of blue to give it that homestead vibe. As for the design approach this will be a very relaxed chilled vibe with a warm earthy feeling as well as visually appealing soft tones. This tone will also be carried into the font by using baguet script for less important information and using Aptos or Aptos narrow for the more important information this will help the more important information standout and have a more professional feel. The user experience will be great with what is currently proposed however people hate clicking multiple times in a website so we will have a list view of all the navigation links that will allow a user to only click once to go to where they want to go. There will also be easy to read colour schemes and there will be a mute background colour that will liven up the pages and make them look more appealing.


6.	Technical Requirements
•	The domain name requirements require the domain name to be unique this you will have to check for availability with a domain registry. As for the web hosting you will need to choose a reliable web hosting provider as well as a provider that allows for specific needs such as optimal storage bandwidth etc. as for the coding language, I will be coding this website in HTML.

7.	Timeline and milestones
•	This is an important step as the timeline for completion is summer this will provide me with a basic work structure to follow as well as setting up completion milestones such as in week one I would like to be done with the skeleton of the website having it somewhat run with no UI design aspects to it this will allow me to focus on the design in week 2 allowing for basic designs to be completed such as font choosing as well as background colours and images in week 3 would come adding information to the website such as the history of the business as well as a small about and adding in the some more images this timeline will change depending on how the business owners like or dislike the design however the general deadline will be summer of this year.

8.	Budget
•	In the first month your cost would be high as the developer will be charged at 6000 Rand to develop the website, and hosting will cost 790 Rand a month and maintenance and support will cost 250 Rand for the first 15 hours after 15 hours a quote will have to be made. So in total for the first month, you are looking at a budget of around 8040 Rand after the first month the cost will drop to around 1040 rand a month.

This is a rough idea of what my website will look like when finished however it will be refined to a more professional format, and it will be a lot more colourful and inviting. The colour scheme I have chosen is a very earthy tone like greens, browns and blues this colour scheme will remain the same throughout the website.

Sitemap
The first page will be the home page this will be the hub for all the other page this is where the custoimer will first enter the experience after that the customer can choose which page to go for however the events and products page will stand out more as these are the two pages we want customers to visit.
After that the about us page is the next most important page as it will help customers to understand and empathize with the goals of the business. This is key to getting a loyal customer basis.
The last important page is the contacts page this page is for people who are curious about the products and what the pricing is like.
